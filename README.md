## Configuration

CalendarMetrics uses YAML configuration files located in the `config/` directory:

### 1. Calendars (`calendars.yaml`)

This file defines your calendar categories and their properties:

```yaml
calendars:
  work:
    file: "2Work.ics"
    category: "WORK"
    color: "#4287f5"
    description: "Work-related activities"
    
  sleep:
    file: "3Sleep.ics"
    category: "SLEEP"
    color: "#f54242"
    description: "Sleep activities"
    
  errands:
    file: "4Errands.ics"
    category: "ERRANDS"
    color: "#42f554"
    description: "Errand activities"
```

### 2. Text Replacements (`text_replacements.yaml`)

Define common typos or variations to be standardized:

```yaml
replacements:
  "meting": "meeting"
  "developement": "development"
  "synq": "sync"
```

### 3. Holidays and Vacations (`holidays.yaml`)

Specify dates to exclude from analysis by year:

```yaml
holidays:
  2024:
    - "2024-01-01"  # New Year's Day
    - "2024-12-25"  # Christmas

vacations:
  2024:
    - start: "2024-07-15"
      end: "2024-07-30"
      description: "Summer Break"
```

### 4. Time Periods (`time_periods.yaml`)

Define fiscal year settings and analysis date range:

```yaml
default_periods:
  quarter:
    start_month: 9  # September
    duration_months: 3
  year:
    start_month: 9  # September
    end_month: 8    # August next year

active_range:
  start_date: "2024-01-01"
  end_date: "2024-12-31"
```

## Calendar Event Format

With the multi-calendar approach, each calendar file should contain events for a specific category. The event summaries can be in any format since the categorization is now handled by the calendar file itself.

Example event summaries:
- Work calendar: "Team meeting", "Project planning", "Code review"
- Sleep calendar: "Sleep", "Nap", "Rest"
- Errands calendar: "Grocery shopping", "Doctor appointment", "Car maintenance"

## Output

The tool generates several visualizations in the `
